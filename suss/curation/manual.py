# Need to show metrics, locations in plot, similarity to other clusters,
# response properties

# interaction should be grouping clusters together - should be able to
# see the result

# should be able to save the output as a list of putative clusters
# with annotations such as "single" or "multiunit", other researcher
# notes, and other metrics / graphs
